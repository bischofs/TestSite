1. Regression
   - Need to omit the first five seconds
   - Need to finish the filtering
   - Pull the data criteria from the full load curve and show warning in view
2. Test Data
   - Need to verify time stamps on files so that they correlate and correlate with the ebench databse
   - Need to check the data for frequency ( 1HZ) and show in the meta view
   - After initial data checks remove the channels that are not required from the data
   - Figure out a way to read values from header data and apply as criteria to the test data
   - File ordering, form the header data I need to get what the file is and if test data what is test cycle
   - Grab fuel data From header file and compare it to all files. If it is different error
3. Zero Span Files
   - Sanity checks on zero span files, check for all required channels and length 
   - Grap zero and floor values for each channel 
4. Workflow
   - Modify so you cannot load test data before preceding files
   - Need to add Detioration factor for each emission species as a input into file upload
   - Need to output or show every aspect of the calculations 


5. File Upload
   - Channel check - Hit ebench database to find out which channels are "active"
   - Header check 
   - Unit check
   - Range check
   - Build channel mapping dictionary from all files
   - Correlate Time stamps so that pre and post are before and after
   - Correlate frequency to 1HZ for all files 
   - Correlate fuel data for all files
