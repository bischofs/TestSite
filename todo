1. Regression
   - Need to omit the first five seconds
   - Need to finish the filtering
   - Pull the data criteria from the full load curve and show warning in view
2. Test Data
   - Need to check the data for frequency ( 1HZ) and show in the meta view
   - After initial data checks remove the channels that are not required from the data
   - Figure out a way to read values from header data and apply as criteria to the test data
   - File ordering, form the header data I need to get what the file is and if test data what is test cycle
3. Zero Span Files
   - Sanity checks on zero span files, check for all required channels and length 
3. Workflow
   - Optimize so you cannot load test data before preceding files
